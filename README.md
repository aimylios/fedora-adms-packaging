# Packaging ADMS for Fedora

ADMS is an **A**utomatic **D**evice **M**odel **S**ynthesizer. Please visit the [official ADMS website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mot-adms/) for details.

As of July 2018, Fedora only ships version 2.3.4 of the [mot-adms](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/mot-adms) package. To make it easier for me and other Fedora users to use the current version of ADMS, I decided to prepare my own RPM.

This repository only includes the SPEC description file for the ADMS RPM and all of the packaging scripts. The ready-made RPMs are available via my personal [aimylios/electronics](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/aimylios/electronics/) Copr repository.
